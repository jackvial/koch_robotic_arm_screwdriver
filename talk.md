# Introduction
Going to walk through creating a 3D model from code with OpenSCAD.
We'll export the model to STL file, prepare it for 3D printing, and print it.

# Basic Shapes
Cover creating basic shapes with OpenSCAD.

# Difference
Using the difference function to make holes in shapes.

# Screwdriver Chuck
Describe the screwdriver chuck and walk through the code.

# Exporting To STL
Render the model and export to STL.

# Slicing With Bamboo Studio
Slice to generate the G-code for the printer.   

# Printing 
Print the model with the printer.

# Next Time
Vision language action (VLA) models used in robotics like SmolVLA are very similar to VLMs used for Browser Use and the advancements in robotics will feedback into models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and make them even better at agentic reasoning tasks like browser automation.
